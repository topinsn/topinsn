                    I was born and raised in southwestern part of Nigeria and traversed over 19 states out of the 36 states in the country. I moved to Toronto Canada about 4 months ago as a permanent resident. I have always loved technology and I’ve worked overtime as a technical support and an administrator for over 5 years as I also like interfacing with people. My father thought me how to do menial repairs of electric sockets and extensions, which sparked my love for electronic and electrical equipment. He thereafter bought me my first computer when I was 13; I locked myself indoors all night trying to understand how to navigate, rectify errors and understand which errors there are at certain given point. <br/><br/>
                    I started my career as an IT support and built my first website using WordPress for the NGO, I was working for but was turned down because in Nigeria, it is believed you must have a computer science or science degree to do any of these at that time. As I failed to meet the basic requirement, I continued as an administrator and IT support for a while. At the next organisation I worked in, a Hospital, I designed the web architecture and framework to which laid the foundation of our IT infrastructure. As an administrator, I tasked myself into revering bad debts and increasing the organisation’s income. I persistently met and discussed with debtors why we were not being paid. I discovered poor documentation was the main reason. This, I setup a requisition, billing, and reporting models where I was able to recover over 90% of the debts owed by health insurance – about 6 million Naira. During my time, the company’s monthly turnover increased from 2 million to 12 million Naira a month which made us to upgrade our infrastructure and isolate departments for proper functioning. 
                    The gap between having an idea and poor execution made me venture into attending a bootcamp to learn web development, as I am in control of the concept and execution, which of course might be with the input and cooperation with others. Since then, I’ve learnt to build applications using PHP, MySQL, Bootstrap, JavaScript, HTML and CSS. This passion is making me to build a web application on my free time which I aim it will help the Nigeria Primary Health Centres to collate health data faster without wasting much time and risking their lives by travelling. The basic framework has been laid and I keep learning every day to make the application better and robust to capture all the needs of the health center.
